* Implement:
Once assessment and planning have been completed, the next step is implementing the strategies and interventions that will comprise the workplace health program. Program implementation involves all the steps needed to put health promotion strategies and interventions into place and make them available to employees.
* Roles:
Keeping the lines of communication open is perhaps the most important role of employees during the implementation process. This includes taking the time to voice concerns, seek out answers and resolve any difficulties as changes are put in place.
* Example:
To implement is defined as to put something into effect. An example of implement is a manager enforcing a new set of procedures. The definition of implement is a tool that is used to perform a job. A plow is an example of a farm implement.
