* The main features of this project include basic file handling operations; you will learn how to add, list, modify and delete data to/from file. The source code is relatively short, so thoroughly go through the mini project, and try to analyze how things such as functions, pointers, files, and arrays are implemented.

Currently, listed below are the only features that make up this project, but you can add new features as you like to make this project a better one!

* ## Add record
* ## List record
* ## Modify record
* ## Delete record
The functions used in this project are simple and they basically manipulate file handling and data structures. So, I will only describe the gotoxy function used in this project. Try to understand how this functions works as you may want to use it or find it used in many other C mini projects.
